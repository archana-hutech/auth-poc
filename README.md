# Server Setup

# Express Server Application

This project is an Express.js server application that is configured to connect to a Sequelize database. It also includes setup for CORS, body parsing, and optional email functionality using Nodemailer.

## Features

- **Express Server:** The core of the application, handling incoming HTTP requests.
- **Sequelize Integration:** Connects to a database using Sequelize and handles authentication and synchronization.
- **CORS Support:** Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Body Parsing:** Parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers.
- **Environment Variable Support:** Configuration through `.env` files.
- **Email Sending (Commented Out):** There is commented-out code for sending emails using Nodemailer.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:  npm install
3. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add the following environment variables
4. Start the Server: npm start.

## Database Connection

The application uses Sequelize to connect to a database. Ensure that the correct database credentials are provided in the `.env` file.

SERVERHOST=your_server_host
DBNAME=your_database_name
DB_NAME=your_database_name
port=3000


## Usage

* The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.
* Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the welcome message.


## Nodemailer Email Functionality (Optional)

If you want to enable email functionality:

1. Uncomment the Nodemailer code in `index.js`.
2. Replace the email credentials with your own.
3. Use the `/send-email` endpoint to send emails by making a POST request with the following JSON body:
   {
   "to": "recipient@example.com",
   "subject": "Your Subject",
   "text": "Your email text"
   }
